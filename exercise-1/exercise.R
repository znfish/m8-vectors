# Exercise 1: Creating and Indexing Vectors
v <- c(1, 2, 3)
# Create a vector `first.ten` that has the values 10 through 20 in it (using the : operator)
first.ten <- c(10 : 20)

# Create a vector `next.ten` that has the values 21 through 30 in it (using the seq operator)
next.ten <- c(21 : 30)

# Create a vector `all.numbers` by combining the vectors `first.ten` and `next.ten`
all.numbers <- first.ten + next.ten

# Create a variable `eleventh` that is equal to the 11th element in your vector `all.numbers`
eleventh <- all.numbers[11]

# Create a vector `some.numbers` that is equal to the second through the 5th elements of `all.numbers`
some.numbers <- c(all.numbers[2 : 5])

# Create a variable `len` that is equal to the length of your vector `all.numbers`
len <- length(all.numbers)

### Bonus ###

# Create a vector `odd` that holds the odd numbers from 1 to 100
odd <- c()

# Using the `all` and `%%` operators, confirm that all of the numbers in your `odd` vector are odd
